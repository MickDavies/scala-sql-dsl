h1. Scala SQL DSL

h2. Scala implementation of a really small subset of the SQL language

To understand how to write DSLs (internal/external) in Scala I started implementing a small subset of the SQL language. 

Implemented:

* select operation with fields
* where clause with (typed) equals, in, and, or
* order
* A 'renderer' to create a SQL String from the given Query object

Scala SQL DSL lets you write stuff like:

<pre>
scala> val q = select ("*") from ("user") where (("name","peter") and (("active", true) or ("role", "admin")))
scala> q.sql
res0: java.lang.String = select * from user where (name = 'peter' and (active = true or role = 'admin'))
</pre>

Or using the parser:

<pre>
scala> val sql = """select name,age from users where name = "peter" and (active = true or age = 30)"""
scala> val query = p.parse(sql).get
scala> AnsiSqlRenderer.sql(query)
res0: java.lang.String = select name,age from users where (name = 'peter' and (active = true or age = 30))
</pre>

h2. Prerequisites

* buildr 1.4.0
* scala 2.8.0.r19281-b20091026023411 (should work with more recent versions as well)

h2. Usage

The spec contains various examples on how to write queries. But basically you start by:

* Import all functions/implicits in the QueryBuilder object: import QueryBuilder._
* Import the AnsiSqlRenderer object: AnsiSqlRenderer._
